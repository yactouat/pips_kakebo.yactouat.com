## What is this ?

This is your Next budget planning application. I actually bought a physical copy of a kakeboo book lately, it litteraly changed my life, so I decided to make a digital version of it.

To run the dev server: `npm run dev`.

## How to deploy it ?

We recommend using Vercel for deployments.
